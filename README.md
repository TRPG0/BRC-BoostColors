Change the colors of the boost effects by editing `BepInEx\config\trpg.brc.boostcolors.cfg`.

Can be edited and reloaded while the game is still running.

Install the mod via [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/TRPG/BoostColors/), or by following the steps below:

1. Download and install [BepInEx 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) in your Bomb Rush Cyberfunk root folder. *Do not use any pre-release versions of BepInEx 6.*

2. Start Bomb Rush Cyberfunk once so that BepInEx can create its required configuration files.

3. Download `BoostColors.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/TRPG0/BRC-BoostColors/releases) page and put it into `BepInEx\plugins`.
